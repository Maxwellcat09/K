//Arrays are very simple in K, they can be created like so
start{{
declare examplearray (integer) (array(3)) (file)
setvar examplearray (7,9,12)
}}end
//this has made an Integer Array, this is the simplest form of array provided by K other than a boolean array, which can be seen below
start{{
declare examplebool (bool) (array(A,B,C)) (file)
setvar examplebool (True,False,True)
}}end
//this is a boolean array, also called a Binary Array due to its ability to be simplified to binary in theory
//this next array is called a Coordinates array, an integer array with letter ids of X and Y, when placed into an operator that requires coordinates, will act as a coordinate.
start{{
declare examplecoord (int) (array(x,y)) (file)
setvar examplecoord (x==9,y==3)
}}end
//as you can see, arrays are extremely simple in K, and are possibly one of the most important parts when it comes to making programs, as they can be used everywhere from games to art programs and many more things.
