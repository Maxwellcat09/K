1. If/Else statements
  1a. Basic if statements

--------------------
if
An if statement checks if all condition is equal to the desired value, then does a set of instructions
Usage:

if {
(variable == true);
(array(7) == 5.2);
} then {
printm {
("Hello");
("World!");
}
This simple program will check if "variable" is true and if the 7th datapoint in "array" is 5.2, and will then print "Hello" on line one, and "World!" on line 2.
--------------------
if(any) 
An if(any) statement checks if any condition is equal to the desired value, then does a set of instructions
Usage:

if(any) {
(variable == true);
array {
(7 == 5.2);
}
} then {
printm {
("Hello");
("World!");
}
This simple program will check if either "variable" is true or if the 7th datapoint in "array" is 5.2, and will then print "Hello" on line one, and "World!" on line 2.

--------------------
else
An else statement will be ran if an if statement's conditions are not met
Usage:

if {
(variableString == "hello");
} then {
printf(variableString /n%/ "world!");
} else {
print("Goodbye!");
}
This code snippet checks if a variable called "variableString" is text "hello" and then formatted prints the variable's data on line 1, and then prints "world!" on the next line. If the variable is not "hello", then it 
prints "Goodbye!"

--------------------
elseif
An elseif statement works like an if statement combined with an else statement. Basically, its an else statement that also requires conditions to function.
Usage:

if {
colorArray{
(1 == 30);
(2 == 0);
(3 == 110);
}
} then {
printf(colorArray(1,2,3) /n%/ " Blue!");
} elseif {
colorArray{
(1 == 110);
(2 == 0);
(3 == 30);
} then {
printf(colorArray(1,2,3) /n%/ " Burgundy!");
} else {
print("Im not sure");
func r (userColorPrompt);
print("Ah, I see now, the color is " (userColorAnswer) ", I'll remember that!")
clone(userColorAnswer) (userColorMemory(1))
}
This code allows a user to specify 2 specific numbers, a simple print code will then "recognize" those colors. if it does not recognize the color, it clones it to a dynamic variable. a dynamic variable is a variable that 
has (n) somewhere in its name and can have that number (n) increased when a different variable is cloned to it.
