1. Selection statements
  1a. if/elseif/else/then

--------------------
if
An if statement checks if all condition is equal to the desired value, then does a set of instructions
Usage:

if {
  (variable == true);
  (array(7) == 5.2);
} then {
  printm {
    ("Hello");
    ("World!");
  }
}
This simple program will check if "variable" is true and if the 7th datapoint in "array" is 5.2, and will then print "Hello" on line one, and "World!" on line 2.

--------------------
if(any) 
An if(any) statement checks if any condition is equal to the desired value, then does a set of instructions
Usage:

if(any) {
  (variable == true);
  array {
    (7 == 5.2);
  }
} then {
  printm {
    ("Hello");
    ("World!");
  }
}
This simple program will check if either "variable" is true or if the 7th datapoint in "array" is 5.2, and will then print "Hello" on line one, and "World!" on line 2.

--------------------
else
An else statement will be ran if an if statement's conditions are not met
Usage:

if {
  (variableString == "hello");
} then {
  printf(variableString /n%/ "world!");
} else {
  print("Goodbye!");
}
This code snippet checks if a variable called "variableString" is text "hello" and then formatted prints the variable's data on line 1, and then prints "world!" on the next line. If the variable is not "hello", then it 
prints "Goodbye!"

--------------------
elseif
An elseif statement works like an if statement combined with an else statement. Basically, its an else statement that also requires conditions to function.
Usage:

array c public "colorArray" (decimal) (1-3);
array s (colorArray) {
    (1,30);
    (2,0);
    (3,110);
}
func c public "userColorPrompt" {
    var c public "userColorAnswer" (string)
    prompt (userColorAnswer);
}
if {
    colorArray{
        (1 == 30);
        (2 == 0);
        (3 == 110);
    }
} then {
    printf(colorArray(1,2,3) /n%/ " Blue!");
} elseif {
    colorArray{
        (1 == 110);
        (2 == 0);
        (3 == 30);
} then {
    printf(colorArray(1,2,3) /n%/ " Burgundy!");
} else {
    print("Im not sure");
    func r (userColorPrompt);
    print("Ah, I see now, the color is " (userColorAnswer) ", I'll remember that!");
    clone(userColorAnswer) (userColorMemory(1));
}
This code allows a user to specify 2 specific numbers, a simple print code will then "recognize" those colors. if it does not recognize the color, it clones it to a dynamic variable. a dynamic variable is a variable that 
has (n) somewhere in its name and can have that number (n) increased when a different variable is cloned to it.
elseif(any) is also a statement, but i can't be asked to make an entire code block for it rn

--------------------

  1b. switch statements

--------------------
switch
Switch statements allow you to choose a "case" based on a variable's value
Usage:

var c file "intVariable" int
var s (intVariable) (2)
switch(intVariable) {
  case 1:
    print("One!");
    break;
  case 2:
    print("Two!");
    break;
  default:
    print(intVariable "!");
}
This snippit of code would print "Two!" and would then break out of the switch statement. if the int were 1, it would print "One!", and if it was anything else, it would print the number, and then an exclaimation point

--------------------
2. Direct flow control

--------------------
jump()
Jumps to a specified line
Usage:

jump(7)
Jumps to line 7

--------------------
