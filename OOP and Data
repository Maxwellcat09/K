1. Creation of Classes, Objects, Variables, ETC.
  1a. Simples
----------
variable c OR var c
This syntax will create a "variable", variables are singular values that only hold one piece of data, like an Integer, Decimal, String or other datatype.
usage:

var c "variable" (int);
Creates an integer named "variable"

variable c "HohnDojName" (string);
Creates a string named "HohnDojName"

----------
array c
This creates an "array", Arrays can hold multiple values of the same datatype.
usage:
array c "array" (decimal) (1-10);
Creates a decimal array called "array"

----------
mixedArray c OR mArray c
This creates a "mixed array", Mixed arrays can hold multiple values of multiple datatypes.
usage:
mArray c "mixedArray" {
(1-50) (int)
(51-100) (dec)
};
Creates a Mixed Array called "mixedArray" with data 1-50 being integers, and 51-100 being decimals.

  1b. Objects
----------
class c
Creates a class, a fundamental of OOP languages and a "blueprint" for objects.
usage:
class c public "class" {
"name:" (string)
"age:" (int)
};
Creates a class called "class" which is public (accessible by all "linked" files)
class c file "state" {
"name:"
"capital:"
"population:"
};
Creates a class called "state" which is file-accessible (accessible by only code in the file)
class c sub "city" {
"name:"
"population:"
};
Creates a class called "city" which is only sub-file-accessible (accessible only by code between the start{{ and }}end brackets, aka sub-file)
